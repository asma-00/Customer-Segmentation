# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their characteristics and spending behavior. By identifying distinct groups within a customer base, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze and preprocess customer data
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Visualize clusters using PCA
- Interpret cluster profiles and suggest business strategies

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/mall-customers)

## Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical data, feature scaling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Pair plots, distribution plots, correlation analysis
- **Clustering Algorithms**:
  - K-Means (Elbow Method)
  - Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrograms)
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - PCA for visualizing clusters in 2D
- **Cluster Profiling**: Understanding demographic and behavioral differences among clusters

## Visualizations

- Cluster scatter plots (PCA-reduced)
- Dendrogram (Hierarchical)
- Pairplots and histograms for feature exploration

## Tools

- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcomes

- Discovered 5 distinct customer segments
- Gained insights into spending behavior and demographics
- Proposed targeted marketing strategies for each group

> This project demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning in customer analytics and shows how businesses can translate data into strategy.
